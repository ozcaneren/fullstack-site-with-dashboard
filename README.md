## Getting Started

Follow these steps to get started with the project:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.

```bash
git clone (https://github.com/ozcaneren/bookmark-app.git)
```


2. Navigate to the `client` directory and install the required dependencies.
```bash
cd client
npm install
```

3. Similarly, navigate to the `server` directory and install the required dependencies.
```bash
cd ../server
npm install
```

4. Open two separate terminal windows or tabs.

5. In the first terminal, navigate to the `client` directory and start the React app.
```bash
cd client
npm start
```



This will start the React development server for the frontend.

6. In the second terminal, navigate to the `server` directory and start the Node.js server.
```bash
cd ../server
npm start
```
This will start the Node.js server for the backend.

Now you have both the client and server running in separate terminals. You can access the application by opening your web browser and navigating to http://localhost:3000.
